This repository contains the code and datasets used in my dissertation, which focuses on climate data analysis and visualization for Ireland and Germany, and its application to ecological experiments.
# Project Structure

The repository is organized into several zip files, each corresponding to a specific aspect of the analysis.
# Zip Files
Each zip file contains:
Python Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) – This includes the code and documentation for the analysis.
Dataset – The climate data used in the corresponding analysis.
1. Ireland_Interactive_Maps.zip
Purpose: Develops interactive maps for visualizing climate data in Ireland.
Contents: Python scripts to generate interactive maps using geographic data and climate indices.
2. Ireland_Seasonal_Analysis.zip
Purpose: Analyzes seasonal climate patterns in Ireland.
Contents: Scripts focused on calculating and visualizing seasonal changes over time.
3. Ireland_Regional_Analysis.zip
Purpose: Regional climate analysis in Ireland to study climate variability across different areas.
Contents: Regional breakdown of climate trends and patterns.
4. Germany.zip
Purpose: Analysis of climate data from Germany.
Contents: Python code for the extraction, processing, and visualization of German climate data.
5. Jena_Experiment.zip
Purpose: Analysis of the Jena Experiment, which focuses on the effects of climate on biodiversity.
Contents: Ecological experiment data combined with climate metrics for Germany.
6. Comparison_Ireland_Germany.zip
Purpose: Comparative analysis of climate trends between Ireland and Germany.
Contents: Comparative visualizations and statistical analysis.

# Web Application Development Files
The web application development files are located in the Dissertation directory. These files are directly uploaded due to their large size. The web app is designed to visualize and interact with climate data, offering user-friendly interfaces for exploring trends, comparing indices, and more. The web app deployed can be accessed directly by using the link: https://climatepredictions.shinyapps.io/apppy/
